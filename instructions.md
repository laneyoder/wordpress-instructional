# Uploading your static html site to wordpress and make it html friendly.

## Introduction

Wordpress is a tool that many of us will have to become more familiar with as we start designing for clients. Clients who are not familiar with code language need to be able to manage their website and make simple changes if they need to, and Wordpress does this for them.

As we learned in Web 2, we as designers can create a static site to be designed just how we want, make it into a custom Wordpress theme, and then continue to put our content into Wordpress and create loops to make our content appear how we want. Doing this a lot of times either means sacrificing parts of our design, or making it extremely difficult for "normal" people to manage their website through Wordpress after we're done. So what are some ways we can accomplish this?

## Creating a Wordpress theme

By first creating a static site through html and css we can get our site to look exactly the way we want it to, and begin to make that into our custom Wordpress theme. To remember how to do this, you can just create a very simple page with a header, body, footer, and a few styles and follow the instructions we used during Web 2: https://github.com/philschanely/vcd-3600-content/blob/master/wordpress-themes.md
